# UnixShell

This is a simple project in C that is supposed to simulate the use of a Unix-based shell inside a Windows environment.

## Install

Run:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ItayNaf/UnixShell.git
```

Then open `UnixShell.sln` on Visual Studio.

Note: this was tested on Visual Studio 2022, so using it on other versions may cause issues.
